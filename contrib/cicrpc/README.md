### CICRPC
Allows for sending of all standard CICcoin commands via RPC rather than as command line args.

### Looking for Wallet Tools?
CICRPC.py is able to do the exact same thing as `walletchangepass.py` and `walletunlock.py`. Their respective commands in CICRPC.py are:

	CICrpc.py walletpassphrasechange
	CICrpc.py walletpassphrase
